ofxVoronoiGL is an openFrameworks addon for creating generalized 2D voronoi diagrams by drawing via OpenGL. It is based on Hoff et. al.â€™s paper (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=311567) with some own modifications to be useful as a preprocessing for skeletonization of silhouettes.

The addon was developed in late 2010 but is now ported to of007. examples are comming soon.

In addition to openFrameworks no further libraries are needed.
