ofxVoronoiGL is an openFrameworks addon for creating generalized 2D voronoi diagrams by drawing via OpenGL. It is based on Hoff et. al.â€™s paper (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=311567) with some own modifications to be useful as a preprocessing for skeletonization of silhouettes.

The addon was developed in late 2010 but is now ported to of007. Try out the small example. Feedback is welcome.

In addition to openFrameworks no further libraries are needed.

At the moment there is NO DCEL like data structure or functionality to work with the resulting voronoi diagram. So you can see the results but cant simply work with them.
